Film students often run into the issue of needing a score to accompany their short film. Soundcloud, garageband, or previously recorded scores can serve as a quick fix but ultimately take away from the final product. ScoreYourFilm offers a new solution to that issue. 

Charging an affordable, flat rate depending on the length of the film, we provide a new and personalized score to your short film. Our goal is to help your film stand out from others, while also enhancing the directorial experience by creating more of a collaborative environment to work towards a more unique final product. Treat your eyes, AND your ears.
